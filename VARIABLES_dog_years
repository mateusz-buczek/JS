/* Task from Codeacademy JS course 
  Training the use of variables by creating dog years calculator (takes human age and converts to dog age)
  */

// variable containing human age
const myAge = 29;
// variable for "infant" years 
let earlyYears = 2;
earlyYears = 10.5 * earlyYears;
// subtracting early years from my age for proper calcucations 
let laterYears = myAge - earlyYears;
// multiplying by 4 to get dog adult years
laterYears *= 4;

// checking if everything fits
console.log(earlyYears, laterYears);

// calculating actual dog age 
myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears;

// variable for lowercased name 
myName = 'Human'.toLowerCase();

// presenting results 
console.log(`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`)
